* Meeting time: Monday-Wednesday-Friday 12-12:50
* Classroom: VMH 1203
* Instructor: Bobby Brame (rbrame@umd.edu)
* Office: LeFrak 2139
* Standing office hours: Monday 2-3:30 (meetings also available by appointment).

#### Class overview 

This class will cover a series of case studies examining a range of crime and delinquency prevention initiatives. We will consider the theoretical assumptions, program design, and evaluation evidence pertaining to each initiative.

#### UMd Course-related policies 

In this class, we will follow all of the guidance and requirements described in "Course-Related Policies and Resources for Undergraduate Students" [link](https://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html). Please review the webpage and let me know if you have any questions. 

#### Course grades

Grades will be based on your performance on 4 in-class exams and 2 written prevention reports. Each of the 4 exams will be graded on a 0-100 point scale. Each of the 2 writing assignments will be graded on a 0-50 point scale. This means you can earn up to 500 points. The letter grade scale is: A+ = 484 and higher; A = 467-483; A-- = 450-466; B+ = 434-449; B = 417-433; B-- = 400-416; C+ = 384-399; C = 367-383; C-- = 350-366; D+ = 334-349; D = 317-333; D-- = 300-316; 
F = 299 and lower.

#### Excused absences

If you need to miss an exam or submit a late report (for an excused reason), please ensure you follow University procedures ([link](https://policies.umd.edu/assets/section-v/V-100G.pdf)) for timely notification and completion of late work. If you are unable to attend class due to COVID quarantine, please contact me to make arrangements.

#### Exams

Each exam will be a combination of multiple choice and true false questions. We will have time for review during the last class period before each exam. After exams have been graded, you can come to office hours or schedule an appointment to review your exam.

#### Prevention reports

For each report, you should identify a prevention program from this [link](https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/programs-practices) that is not discussed in class. If you have any questions about whether the program you've identified is a prevention program or whether the peer-reviewed study you're planning to use is appropriate, you should consult with me (so you don't lose points). Your written submission will then be graded according to the following equally weighted 10-point rubric: 

* Describe the problem the program is targeting for prevention. Your description should include a characterization of the program as: (1) community; (2) developmental; and/or (3) situational crime prevention.
* Identify a peer-reviewed study evaluating the prevention program.
* Explain the evaluation's theoretical motivation.
* Identify the concepts that were measured in the evaluation.
* Describe 1 significant strength and 1 significant weakness of the measurement strategy.
* Explain the research design that was used for the evaluation.
* Describe 1 significant strength and 1 significant weakness of the research design.
* Explain the study's findings.
* Consider the study's policy and research implications.
* Assessment is typed and formatted with appropriate headings for each of the above items; good grammar, syntax, spelling, and writing form.
